## Introduction  
You've just joined Pymaceuticals, Inc., a new pharmaceutical company that  
specializes in anti-cancer medications. Recently, it began screening for potential  
treatments for squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), a commonly occurring form of skin cancer.  

As a senior data analyst at the company, you've been given access to the complete  
data from their most recent animal study. In this study, 249 mice who were identified  
with SCC tumors received treatment with a range of drug regimens. Over the course of  
45 days, tumor development was observed and measured. The purpose of this study was  
to compare the performance of Pymaceuticalsâ€™ drug of interest, Capomulin, against the  
other treatment regimens.  

The executive team has tasked you with generating all of the tables and figures needed  
for the technical report of the clinical study. They have also asked you for a top-level  
summary of the study results.
